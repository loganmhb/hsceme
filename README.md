# hsceme

Aspirationally compliant implementation of Scheme in Haskell, informed by (but differing from) the implementation in "Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours".

# Implemented

- Basic data types: pairs, atoms, strings, integers, booleans
- Parsing

# TODO

- Lots, starting with, y'know, evaluation
